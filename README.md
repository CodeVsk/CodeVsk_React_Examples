# Example Usage of Libraries in React Projects

This repository contains various examples of using popular libraries in the React ecosystem. Each folder is dedicated to a specific project demonstrating how to use a particular library in a practical context. Here, you'll find examples for:

- [Zustand](#zustand)
- [React Query](#react-query)
- [Cypress](#cypress)
- [MSW](#msw)

## Repository Structure

The repository structure is as follows:

## Libraries and Examples

### Zustand

The `zustand` folder contains an example of a React project using the [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) library, a simple solution for global state management in React.

#### What will be demonstrated:

- Creating a store with Zustand.
- Using hooks to interact with the global state.
- Example of managing state without prop drilling.

### React Query

The `react-query` folder contains an example of using the [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) library, which simplifies the management and synchronization of asynchronous data in React.

#### What will be demonstrated:

- Using the `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks.
- Fetching data from an API and managing the state.
- Configuring caching and automatic refetching.

### Cypress

The `cypress` folder contains an example of a React project with automated tests using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), a tool for frontend testing.

#### What will be demonstrated:

- Basic test structure with Cypress.
- Writing and running integration tests.
- Simulating user interactions with the React application.

### MSW (Mock Service Worker)

The `msw` folder contains an example of how to use the [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) library, which allows you to intercept and mock network requests during development or testing.

#### What will be demonstrated:

- Intercepting and mocking API requests on the frontend.
- Setting up MSW for testing asynchronous data flows.
- Simulating API responses.

## How to Run the Examples

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine.

### Running a Project

1. Navigate to the folder of the project you want to run. For example, for the `zustand` project, run:

   ```bash
   cd zustand
   ```
